Kiyo.AI is a self-learning conversational AI designed to grow smarter through interaction with its users.  
Each conversation contributes to its intelligence system, allowing the model to retain context and improve response quality over time, becoming better and more efficient.

---

## Core Concept

Kiyo.AI is built as an evolving system rather than a static model.

- Intelligence increases with every interaction  
- Context is preserved across conversations  
- Responses improve incrementally through use  

---

## Learning System

Kiyo.AI tracks its growth using clear, measurable metrics:

- Intelligence Level – overall capability multiplier  
- Learning Rate – rate of improvement per interaction  
- Conversation Count – total learning inputs  

---

## Design Philosophy

Kiyo.AI focuses on long-term improvement, scalability, and user-driven learning.  
The goal is consistent progression through real interaction, not fixed or pre-trained behavior.

---

## Vision

An AI that improves naturally over time, becoming more effective, reliable, and intelligent with every conversation.
