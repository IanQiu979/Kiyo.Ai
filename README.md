# Kiyo.AI

Kiyo.AI is a self-learning conversational AI designed to grow smarter through continuous interaction.  
Each conversation contributes to its adaptive intelligence system, allowing the model to retain context and improve response quality over time.

## Core Concept

Kiyo.AI is built as an evolving system rather than a static model.

- Intelligence increases with every interaction  
- Context is preserved across conversations  
- Responses improve incrementally through use  

---

## Learning System

Kiyo.AI tracks its growth using clear, measurable metrics:

- Intelligence Level – overall capability multiplier  
- Learning Rate – rate of improvement per interaction  
- Conversation Count – total learning inputs  

---

## Design Philosophy

Kiyo.AI focuses on long-term improvement, scalability, and user-driven learning.  
The goal is consistent progression through real interaction, not fixed or pre-trained behavior.

## Vision

An AI that improves naturally over time, becoming more effective, reliable, and intelligent with every conversation.
